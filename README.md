<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![IFilterShellView Product Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Aeindus/IFilterShellView)

There are not that many great features built into the window's explorer. It is true however that the explorer is not in fact a `simple` program built by Microsoft. It is rather a quite complicated system that integrates the tools and exposes the interfaces required so as to make development and integration a not that hard of a process. All that is required is access to documentation and code samples that /lead the way/. With that knowledge at hand the explorer is as customizable as it could be - to some extent - of course. 


However, windows namespace extensions are not being developed as many of the modern developers tend to choose the easy path. That is the reason why you won't see new plugins for the windows explorer - Microsoft lacks the will and people lack the knowledge as well as the will :-)

The `IFilterShellView` is an extension built for the windows explorer that improves the searching experience and allows a broader spectrum of actions to be performed on the filtered folders and files. The following methods of fitlering items are suported at the time:
* Via text placement (e.g in the beggining or ending or in the middle)
* Via regular expresion
* Via parsed command that supports filtering via attributes (e.g dates, size, type, extension, ...) as well as the above

The methods can be extended and will be in the future with your support and feedback. The plugin extends the normal behaviour of the windows explorer and minimizes the time you would usually spend searching for items. Moreover it is built using controls that feel native to the windows ecosistem and integrate with the current installed theme. It is a theme aware project which means you don't have to worry for a bright light during the night.
